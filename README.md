# Atom Commander

Dual-pane file manager for Atom.

This is not meant to replace the tree view nor to be a full featured file manager. More features will be added in time, but the primary focus is to provide a way to browse the file system in a way that's familiar to many people.

After installing Atom Commander, press `F9` or choose `Atom Commander: Toggle Focus` from the Command Palette to show the panel and focus it. The panel can be hidden with `F10` or `Atom Commander: Toggle Visible`.

### Quick Menu
This is still experimental. The purpose is to quickly navigate the menus without using the mouse.

The menu is opened by holding down the `Alt` key. Releasing the key will close the menu again.

The menus are shown at the top of the panel in the form of buttons. Each button is numbered. Pressing the corresponding number will open that menu. Since these are buttons they can be clicked on as well.

Entering a menu will show its items and potential sub menus. These are also numbered. There will also be an extra button on the left to return to the parent menu. The keys `0`, `Escape` and `Shift` are all valid keys for returning to the parent menu.
